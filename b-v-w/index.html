    <p>Who wins a battle between a full grown bear and a wolfpack?</p>
    <p>Let’s set the stage. Both parties are very hungry and desperate for food. The bear is full-sized adult in its prime, 
      and the pack has 7 wolves. They find the abandoned remains of a freshly shot and killed moose. 
      </p>
    <p>There’s no time limit, and neither party will back down until the other is dead. There must be a winner! Who would you pick to win the contest?</p>

    <p>Pros for the Bear</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Can easily handle at least 2 wolves on its own</li>
      <li>Superior strength and stamina</li>
      <li>Can camp at the site of the carcass</li>
      <li>Can maul or bite a wolf to quickly disable it</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pros for the Wolf pack</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strength in numbers. If they all attack at once</li>
      <li>Can lure bear away from carcass and use guerilla warfare tactics</li>
    </ul>
